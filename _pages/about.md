I am currently a PhD student in the UCL Statistical Science Department, under the supervision of [Karla Diaz-Ordaz](https://kdiazordaz.github.io/) and [Stijn Vansteelandt](https://users.ugent.be/~svsteela/). In my PhD, I will be exploring topics in causal inference, including shift interventions for continuous treatments, heterogeneous treatment effects, and assumption-lean inference.

I am interested in all things causality and causal inference.
