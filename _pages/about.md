I am currently a Research Fellow in Environmental Health Data Science at University College London, working primarily with Laura Horsfall. Our research focuses on understanding the health impacts of non-fossil fuel air pollution exposures - for example residential wood burning and underground rail transport.

In October 2025, I will be starting a PhD in the UCL Statistical Science Department, under the supervision of [Karla Diaz-Ordaz](https://kdiazordaz.github.io/) and [Stijn Vansteelandt](https://users.ugent.be/~svsteela/). In my PhD, I will be exploring topics in causal inference, including shift interventions for continuous treatments, heterogeneous treatment effects, and assumption-lean inference.

I am interested in all things causality and causal inference.
